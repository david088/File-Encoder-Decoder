Project Description:
A project is written in C++ to compress files using HuffmanTree to replacing the letters with binary code which is obtained from constructing the Haffman Tree. 

This project can achieve compressing file by around 50%. (Example: a original file has 3288739 Bytes; the compressed file has 1870740 Bytes). On the other hand, it can also uncompress files to their original size with no data lost.
